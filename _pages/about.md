Welcome to my homepage! I’m Jason, an Assistant Professor at the [Division of Public Health Sciences](https://publichealthsciences.wustl.edu/), [Washington University School of Medicine in St Louis](https://medicine.wustl.edu/). I’m a biostatistician working on developing statistical methodologies as well as collaborating with  investigators from other areas.

## My research
### Multi-view data analysis
Multi-view (or multi-modal) data contains multiple sets of features, such as patients' -omics, imaging, behavior questionare and clinical data. Integrating multi-view data could improve variable selection, dimension reduction and prediction.

### Distributed learning 
Healthcare data (e.g. EHRs or medical claims) usually reside in different sites (e.g. hospitals, companies, databases) and protected by privacy regulations such as [HIPAA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_Insurance_Portability_and_Accountability_Act). The difficulty of sharing individual patient-level data (IPD) across sites prevents the real-world data analysis being conducted in an inclusive and comprehensive manner. I work on developing privacy-protected distributed algorithms ([PDA](https://pdamethods.org/)) that require each site to contribute only aggregated data (AD) in a few rounds. Using PDAs can obtain close (or identical) estimates to the "pooled analysis" that uses IPD from all sites, especially for rare outcomes (e.g. rare diseases). The heterogeneity across sites are also taken into account when developing some PDAs. Check out our R package at [Github](https://github.com/Penncil/pda) and [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=pda).

### Meta-analysis
A [meta-analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-analysis#:~:text=A%20meta%2Danalysis%20is%20a,have%20some%20degree%20of%20error) is an evidence synthesis analysis that uses statistical methods (e.g. inverse variance weighted average) to combine the results of multiple scientific studies (e.g. efficacy and/or safety of certain drug). Novel statistical methods need to be developed for the problems such as publication bias and complex designs.
