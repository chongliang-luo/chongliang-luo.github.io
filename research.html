<h1>Statistical methodology for multi-view data integration</h1>
<p>Multi-view data, also called multi-modal, or vertically distributed data sets, are the data that contains distinct but related sets of characteristics on the same set of subjects.  My dissertation focuses on improving the prediction of multi-view data using reduced-rank based models.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://academic.oup.com/biostatistics/article/17/3/468/1743976,">Canonical Variate Regression</a> for multi-view covariates.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It connects the unsupervised canonical correlation analysis
(CCA) and generalized reduced-rank regression (RRR), see Figure (a). Also check the R package <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/CVR/index.html">CVR</a> on CRAN.</p>

</li>
</ul>
<p>The response variables are dependent, but could follow different distributions (i.e. gaussian, binomial, Poisson) and subject to missing values, see Figure (b). Also check the R package <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rrpack/index.html">rrpack</a> on CRAN .</p>
<h1>Privacy-preserving distributed algorithms (PDAs)</h1>
<p>Data may be collected from subjects that are distributed at multiple sites. These horizontally distributed data sets enable analyses being potentially  conducted with larger sample size and better generalizability. A typical example is the healthcare data that are stored at multiple institutions within a clinical research network. However, due to regulations protecting the privacy of healthcare data, direct sharing of
patient-level data across institutions may be challenging. Privacy-preserving distributed algorithms (PDAs) that are communication-efficient, i.e. only require one or two iterations of data communication, is thus desirable.</p>

<li><p>We proposed a One-shot Distributed Algorithm for Cox regression (ODAC), see <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/jamia/ocaa044">Learning from local to global: An efficient distributed algorithm for modeling time-to-event data</a>, published at <i>JAMIA</i>.</p>

<li><p>See also the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/jamia/ocz199">ODAL</a> algorithm for logistic regression, and more methods are implemented in our <a href="https://github.com/Penncil/pda">pda</a> package on github.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In particular, most of the existing distributed algorithms used in medical informatics settings assumed homogeneity
across clinical sites (i.e., i.i.d. assumption), which does not hold in many settings. Accounting for the between-
site heterogeneity is both important and challenging when integrating multi-site data.</p>

Conditional inference decision tree is created using hearing impairment, CSF pressure, CSF fungal counts and TC, as selected by the random forests. An oval represents a split on a specific variable, along with the corresponding p-value. All variables are included in the decision tree regardless of the significance of their splits. The ratio in each leaf node is the observed proportion of PIIRS in that group. The splits based on CSF fungal counts and TC are not significant, though still show certain separation in the leaf nodes.</p>

<h3>Healthcare quality rating</h3>
<p>Part of my work at the <a href="https://health.uconn.edu/population-health/">Center for Population Health</a> at UConn Health Center was healthcare quality rating, see <a href="https://healthscorect.com/">HealthscoreCT</a>. We mined the Connecticut All Payers Claims Database (<a href="https://www.apcdcouncil.org/">APCD</a>) to rate the healthcare quality of organizations. </p>
